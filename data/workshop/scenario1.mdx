Welcome to the OpenShift Virtualisation Hackathon! Here you'll have a chance to build your container native virtualisation prowess. Exercises will gradually increase in difficulty as you go and award points for each correct solution. You're in a race to reach the highest score before the session concludes!

**Let's get started!**


## 1.1 - Obtaining your environment

Your proctors will allocate you to a team and provide the cluster and bastion connectivity details prior to this lab.


## 1.2 - The hackathon scenario

Acme Financial Services is a large bank based in Australia. They have a number of virtual machine workloads that are running on a traditional hypervisor and are considering moving these to another platform.

One of the potential options for Acme Financial Services is to adopt Red Hat OpenShift Virtualisation as a container native virtualisation platform. 

Your hackathon team are the pre-sales technical team engaging with Acme technical teams to secure buy-in for a large scale migration to proceed.


## 1.3 - Understanding the environment

For this challenge you'll be given a fresh bare metal OpenShift 4 cluster with no OpenShift Virtualisation functionality installed.

All challenge tasks must be performed on this cluster so your solutions can be graded successfully.

You can and are encouraged to use any supporting documentation or other resources in order to tackle each of the challenge tasks.

## 1.4 - Confirm your team name

** REVISIT ** Need to update this based on how we provision the environments.

If your team have secured an environment and are ready to start the challenge please post a message in `#event-anz-ocp-virt-hackathon` with the message:

> Team [name] are using environment [uuid] and starting the challenge!

The event team will reply in slack to confirm your team has been recorded and start you with a base score of `10` points.
