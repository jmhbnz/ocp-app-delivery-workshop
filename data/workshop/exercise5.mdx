We've done the work to set the OpenShift Compliance Operator and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security up on our cluster, now let's make the most of it by using them to schedule and run a compliance scan on our cluster.

For the scan we'll be using the included `NIST 800-53 Moderate-Impact Baseline for Red Hat OpenShift` and `NIST 800-53 Moderate-Impact Baseline for Red Hat OpenShift - Node level` scan profiles that are included with the OpenShift Compliance Operator.

Two scan profiles are required as we need to scan both the OpenShift cluster, as well as each individual node running RHEL CoreOS.

For more details on these compliance profiles please take some time to review:

## 5.1 - Scheduling a scan

There are two methods you can use to schedule Compliance Operator scans:

1. Creating a `ScanSetting` and `ScanSettingBinding` custom resource. This does not require Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, and can be easily managed by GitOps, however is not beginner friendly and lacks any graphical frontend to easily explore cluster compliance status. For an overview of this approach please take a few minutes to review https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/security/compliance_operator/co-scans/compliance-scans.html#compliance-operator-scans
2. Creating a **Scan Schedule** in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security. This is the approach we will be using in this workshop as it is the most intuitive option.

Complete the steps below to create your scan schedule:
