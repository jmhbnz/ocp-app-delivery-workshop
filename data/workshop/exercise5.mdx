---

We've done the work to set the OpenShift Compliance Operator and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security up on our cluster, now let's make the most of it by using them to schedule and run a compliance scan on our cluster.

For the scan we'll be using the included `NIST 800-53 Moderate-Impact Baseline for Red Hat OpenShift` and `NIST 800-53 Moderate-Impact Baseline for Red Hat OpenShift - Node level` scan profiles that are included with the OpenShift Compliance Operator.

Two scan profiles are required as we need to scan both the OpenShift cluster, as well as each individual node running [RHEL CoreOS](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/architecture/architecture-rhcos.html).

## 5.1 - Scheduling a scan

There are two methods you can use to schedule Compliance Operator scans:

1. Creating a `ScanSetting` and `ScanSettingBinding` custom resource. This does not require Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, and can be easily managed by GitOps, however is not beginner friendly and lacks any graphical frontend to easily explore cluster compliance status. For an overview of this approach please take a few minutes to review https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/security/compliance_operator/co-scans/compliance-scans.html#compliance-operator-scans
2. Creating a **Scan Schedule** in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security. This is the approach we will be using in this workshop as it is the most intuitive option.

Complete the steps below to create your scan schedule:

1. Return to your browser tab in the vnc session with the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security dashboard open.
2. Navigate to **Compliance** > **Schedules** in the left hand menu.
3. Click the blue **Create Scan Schedule** button in the middle of the screen.
4. Enter the name `daily-nist-800-53-moderate` and set the **Time** field to `00:00` then click **Next**.
5. On the next screen select your `hub` cluster, then click **Next**.
6. On the profile screen tick `ocp4-moderate` and `ocp4-moderate-node`, then click **Next**.
7. Click **Next** once more on the **Reports** screen and the click **Save**.

After creating the scan schedule results will be shortly available in the RHACS console. While we wait for the automatically triggered initial scan to complete, let's use the `oc` cli to review the `ScanSetting` that was created behind the scenes when we created the **Scan Schedule** in the RHACS dashboard.

Run the commands below to review your `ScanSetting` resource:

```bash
oc get scansetting --namespace openshift-compliance daily-nist-800-53-moderate

oc get scansetting --namespace openshift-compliance daily-nist-800-53-moderate --output yaml
```

You should see details output similar to the example below. Notice the more advanced settings available in the custom resource including `rawResultsStorage.rotation` and `roles[]` which you may want to customize in your environment.

```yaml
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSetting
maxRetryOnTimeout: 3
metadata:
  annotations:
    owner: stackrox
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: sensor
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: sensor
    app.kubernetes.io/name: stackrox
  name: daily-nist-800-53-moderate
  namespace: openshift-compliance
rawResultStorage:
  pvAccessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  rotation: 3
  size: 1Gi
roles:
- master
- worker
scanTolerations:
- operator: Exists
schedule: 0 0 * * *
showNotApplicable: false
strictNodeScan: false
suspend: false
timeout: 30m0s
```


## 5.2 Review cluster compliance

Once your cluster scan completes return to your vnc browser tab with the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Dashboard open. We'll take a look at our overall cluster compliance now against the compliance profile.

> Note: Please be aware of the usage disclaimer shown at the top of the screen *"Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, and its compliance scanning implementations, assists users by automating the inspection of numerous technical implementations that align with certain aspects of industry standards, benchmarks, and baselines. It does not replace the need for auditors, Qualified Security Assessors, Joint Authorization Boards, or other industry regulatory bodies."*.

Navigate to **Compliance** > **Coverage** and review the overall result for the `ocp4-moderate` and `ocp4-moderate-node` profiles. The results should look something similar to the examples below:

Your cluster should come out compliant with ~65% of the `ocp4-moderate` profile and ~93% of the `ocp4-moderate-node` profile. Not a bad start, let's review an example of an individual result now.


## 5.3 Review indvidual compliance results

Reviewing the detailed results any checks that are not passing will either be categorised as `Failing` or `Manual`. While we do everthing we can to automate the compliance process there are still a small number of controls you need to manage outside the direct automation of the Compliance Operator.

Looking at the `ocp4-moderate` results for our `hub` cluster. A good example of a `Manual` check is `ocp4-moderate-accounts-restrict-service-account-tokens`. Let's get an overview of the check, the rationale and our instructions to address it manually by clicking into that check in the list, and opening the **Details** tab. You can jump directly to it with this url: https://central-acs-central.apps.disco.lab/main/compliance/coverage/profiles/ocp4-moderate/checks/ocp4-moderate-accounts-restrict-service-account-tokens?detailsTab=Details

We can see in this example it's essentially a judgement call. Our instructions are:

> For each pod in the cluster, review the pod specification and ensure that pods that do not need to explicitly communicate with the API server have `automountServiceAccountToken` configured to `false`.

Now just because this check is classified as manual, does not mean that we are now all on our own. There are extremely powerful policy engine & policy violation tracking features in RHACS that we can use investigate the status of this check further.

A default policy is available out of the box called **Pod Service Account Token Automatically Mounted**. By default this policy is in **Inform only** mode, which means deployments that violate this policy will not be prevented by the RHACS admission controller, or scaled down if already running by the RHACS runtime protection. However we can still use this policy as is to inform on the current state of the cluster.

1. First let's navigate to **Platform Configuration** > **Policy Management** in the left hand menu.
2. In the Policy list scroll down to find **Pod Service Account Token Automatically Mounted** and click the policy title.
3. Have a read of the policy details, then scroll down to review the **Scope exclusions**. You will see Red Hat has already done some work for you to define some standard OpenShift compoents which do need the token mounted and can be safely excluded from the policy.
4. The policy should already be enabled so let's click on **Violations** in the left hand menu to review any current instances where this policy is currently being violated. You should have one entry in the list for the `kube-rbac-proxy`. This is actually a standard openshift pod in the `openshift-machine-config-operator` namespace, and does actually require the api token mounted, so we could safely add this deployment to our policy exclusions.

At this point as a platform engineer we have some flexibility about how we handle this particular compliance check, some options could be:
