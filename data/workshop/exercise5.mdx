---

We've done the work to set the OpenShift Compliance Operator and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security up on our cluster, now let's make the most of it by using them to schedule and run a compliance scan on our cluster.

For the scan we'll be using the included `NIST 800-53 Moderate-Impact Baseline for Red Hat OpenShift` and `NIST 800-53 Moderate-Impact Baseline for Red Hat OpenShift - Node level` scan profiles that are included with the OpenShift Compliance Operator.

Two scan profiles are required as we need to scan both the OpenShift cluster, as well as each individual node running [RHEL CoreOS](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/architecture/architecture-rhcos.html).

For more details on these compliance profiles please take some time to review:

## 5.1 - Scheduling a scan

There are two methods you can use to schedule Compliance Operator scans:

1. Creating a `ScanSetting` and `ScanSettingBinding` custom resource. This does not require Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, and can be easily managed by GitOps, however is not beginner friendly and lacks any graphical frontend to easily explore cluster compliance status. For an overview of this approach please take a few minutes to review https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/security/compliance_operator/co-scans/compliance-scans.html#compliance-operator-scans
2. Creating a **Scan Schedule** in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security. This is the approach we will be using in this workshop as it is the most intuitive option.

Complete the steps below to create your scan schedule:

1. Return to your browser tab in the vnc session with the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security dashboard open.
2. Navigate to **Compliance** > **Schedules** in the left hand menu.
3. Click the blue **Create Scan Schedule** button in the middle of the screen.
4. Enter the name `daily-nist-800-53-moderate` and set the **Time** field to `00:00` then click **Next**.
5. On the next screen select your `hub` cluster, then click **Next**.
6. On the profile screen tick `ocp4-moderate` and `ocp4-moderate-node`, then click **Next**.
7. Click **Next** once more on the **Reports** screen and the click **Save**.

After creating the scan schedule results will be shortly available in the RHACS console. While we wait for the automatically triggered initial scan to complete, let's use the `oc` cli to review the `ScanSetting` that was created behind the scenes when we created the **Scan Schedule** in the RHACS dashboard.

Run the commands below to review your `ScanSetting` resource:

```bash
oc get scansetting --namespace openshift-compliance daily-nist-800-53-moderate

oc get scansetting --namespace openshift-compliance daily-nist-800-53-moderate --output yaml
```

You should see details output similar to the example below. Notice the more advanced settings available in the custom resource including `rawResultsStorage.rotation` and `roles[]` which you may want to customize in your environment.

```yaml
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ScanSetting
maxRetryOnTimeout: 3
metadata:
  annotations:
    owner: stackrox
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: sensor
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: sensor
    app.kubernetes.io/name: stackrox
  name: daily-nist-800-53-moderate
  namespace: openshift-compliance
rawResultStorage:
  pvAccessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  rotation: 3
  size: 1Gi
roles:
- master
- worker
scanTolerations:
- operator: Exists
schedule: 0 0 * * *
showNotApplicable: false
strictNodeScan: false
suspend: false
timeout: 30m0s
```


## 5.2 Review cluster compliance

Once your cluster scan completes return to your vnc browser tab with the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Dashboard open. We'll take a look at our overall cluster compliance now against the compliance profile.

> Note: Please be aware of the usage disclaimer shown at the top of the screen *"Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, and its compliance scanning implementations, assists users by automating the inspection of numerous technical implementations that align with certain aspects of industry standards, benchmarks, and baselines. It does not replace the need for auditors, Qualified Security Assessors, Joint Authorization Boards, or other industry regulatory bodies."*.

Navigate to **Compliance** > **Coverage** and review the overall result for the `ocp4-moderate` and `ocp4-moderate-node` profiles. The results should look something similar to the examples below:
