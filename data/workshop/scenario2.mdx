summary: "Will OpenShift Virtualisation run Acme virtual machines?"
---

As a sales team you've got an upcoming demo with the Acme Financial Services linux team. They are concerned a modern cloud native virtualisation platform like OpenShift Virtualistion won't run their **Crusty Corp Fun Financial Applianceâ„¢** vm appliances which run CentOS Linux `5.11` and cannot be updated or altered in any way ðŸ¤¯.

The Acme team are well aware these virtual machines would not be "supported" but ultimately the deal rests on your teams ability to prove that an old operating system will boot successfully within OpenShift Virtualisation.


## 2.1 - Create the virtual machine

For this task, your team are required to use this [`CentOS-5.11-x86_64-netinstall.iso`](https://vault.centos.org/5.11/isos/x86_64/CentOS-5.11-x86_64-netinstall.iso) file.

No command line is required. Your challenge is to create and boot a virtual machine on your cluster using the name `crusty-corp-fun-financial-appliance`, within the namespace `crusty-corp`.

## 2.2 - Boot the virtual machine

For this challenge you will know you are successful and will be awarded points when your virtual machine boots the given iso and shows the following logo in vnc console:

## 2.3 - Check your work

If your **Crusty Corp Financial Appliance** has booted please post a message in `#event-anz-ocp-virt-hackathon` with the message:

> Please review team [name] solution for exercise 2.

This exercise is worth 25 points. The event team will reply in slack to confirm your updated team total score.
