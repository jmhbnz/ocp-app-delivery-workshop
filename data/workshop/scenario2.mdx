summary: "Will OpenShift Virtualisation run Acme virtual machines?"
---

As a sales team you've got an upcoming demo with the Acme Financial Services linux team. They are concerned a modern cloud native virtualisation platform like OpenShift Virtualistion won't run their **Crusty Corp Financial Applianceâ„¢** vm appliances which run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.0 and cannot be updated or altered in any way ðŸ¤¯.

The Acme team are well aware these virtual machines would not be "supported" but ultimately the deal rests on your teams ability to prove that an old operating system will boot successfully within OpenShift Virtualisation.


## 2.1 - Create the virtual machine

...

## 2.2 - Boot the virtual machine

...

## 2.3 - Check your work

If your **Crusty Corp Financial Appliance** has booted please post a message in `#event-anz-ocp-virt-hackathon` with the message:

> Please review team [name] solution for exercise 2.

This exercise is worth 25 points. The event team will reply in slack to confirm your updated team total score.
