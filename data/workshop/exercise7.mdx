Now that you've had a taste of most of the more basic deployment methods let's introduce the concept of [GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops) and deploy an application using this more advanced approach.

In simple terms GitOps uses Git repositories as a single source of truth to deliver applications or infrastructure as code. Whenever you merge or push code into a specifc Git branch in a repository, an GitOps continuous delivery tool such as [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable) can then automatically sync that to one or more Kubernetes clusters.

For many organisations GitOps is a goal deployment methodology as application definitions, configurations, and environments should ideally be declarative and version controlled. Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.

Since 2021 OpenShift has included a fully supported [OpenShift GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/announcing-openshift-gitops) operator, based on the upstream ArgoCD project.

This operator has already been installed on your cluster so let's take it for a spin now! ðŸš€
