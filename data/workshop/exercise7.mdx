Now that you've had a taste of most of the more basic deployment methods let's introduce the concept of [GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops) and deploy an application using this more advanced approach.

In simple terms GitOps uses Git repositories as a single source of truth to deliver applications or infrastructure as code. Whenever you merge or push code into a specifc Git branch in a repository, an GitOps continuous delivery tool such as [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable) can then automatically sync that to one or more Kubernetes clusters.

For many organisations GitOps is a goal deployment methodology as application definitions, configurations, and environments should ideally be declarative and version controlled. Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand.

Since 2021 OpenShift has included a fully supported [OpenShift GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/announcing-openshift-gitops) operator, based on the upstream ArgoCD project.

This operator has already been installed on your cluster so let's take it for a spin now! ðŸš€

## 7.1 - Deploy openshift gitops

To get started with OpenShift GitOps we will need an instance of ArgoCD deployed.

Click the **+** button in the top right corner menu bar of the OpenShift web console. This is a fast way to quickly import snippets of YAML for testing or exploration purposes.

Paste the below snippet of YAML into the editor and replace the instance of `userX` with your assigned user.

Click **Create**. In a minute or so you should see the ArgoCD instance running successfully in your project.

```bash
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1beta1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  finalizers:
  - argoproj.io/finalizer
  name: argocd
  namespace: userX
spec:
  defaultClusterScopedRoleDisabled: true
  rbac:
    defaultPolicy: role:admin
    scopes: '[groups]' 
  server:
    route:
      enabled: true
  sourceNamespaces:
  - userX
  sso:
    dex:
      openShiftOAuth: true
    provider: dex
```

## 7.2 Login to argocd

With ArgoCD running let's open the route in a new tab in our browser and click **Log in with OpenShift**.  You can retrieve the ~Route~ by running the following command in your web terminal:

```bash
oc get route argocd-server
```

## 7.3 Deploy an application

Now that you're logged into ArgoCD have a go at deploying
