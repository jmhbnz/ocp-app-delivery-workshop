summary: "Need to integrate results with another platform?"
---

Often organisations will have dedicated software for managing governance, risk and compliance or need to provide results to external auditors. In these situations while the dashboards within Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security, or `ComplianceCheckResult` objects in the OpenShift APIServer are helpful, what we really need to do is integrate these results into our third party compliance management platform or pass results in a standardised format to third parties.

In this exercise, we'll briefly step through retrieving raw compliance results, in the well known **Asset Reporting Framework** (ARF) format.

The Asset Reporting Format is a data model to express the transport format of information about assets, and the relationships between assets and reports. The standardized data model facilitates the reporting, correlating, and fusing of asset information throughout and between organizations. ARF is vendor and technology neutral, flexible, and suited for a wide variety of reporting applications.

## 7.1 - Understanding raw result storage

When the Compliance Operator runs a scan, raw results are stored in a `PersistentVolume`. The following `oc` command shows the mapping `PersistentVolume` name for a given scan name.

Let's use our scan name that we set up previously, `daily-nist-800-53-moderate`:

```bash
 oc get --namespace openshift-compliance compliancesuites daily-nist-800-53-moderate --output json | jq '.status.scanStatuses[].resultsStorage'
```

We should see results showing the name of each `PersistentVolume` for each profile that was scanned, below is an example:

```json
{
  "name": "ocp4-moderate",
  "namespace": "openshift-compliance"
}
{
  "name": "ocp4-moderate-node-master",
  "namespace": "openshift-compliance"
}
{
  "name": "ocp4-moderate-node-worker",
  "namespace": "openshift-compliance"
}
```
