With our Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Operator installed and standing by to do some work for us, let's give it some work to do by telling it to deploy Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for us.


## 4.1 - Getting familiar with rhacs

Before we get into the technical implementation let's take a moment to get up to speed with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security works.

Fundamentally you install RHACS as a set of containers in your OpenShift Container Platform or Kubernetes cluster. RHACS includes the following services:

1. **Central** services you install on a designated "hub" cluster.
2. **Secured cluster** services you install on each cluster you want to secure by RHACS.

## 4.2 - Deploying central services

Let's now create our **Central** services on our cluster by creating a new `Central` custom resource which our newly installed operator will then manage and deploy on our behalf. We'll deploy these services into a new namespace called `acs-central`.

```bash
cat << EOF | oc apply --filename -
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: acs-central
spec:
  finalizers:
  - kubernetes

---
apiVersion: platform.stackrox.io/v1alpha1
kind: Central
metadata:
  name: stackrox-central-services
  namespace: acs-central
spec:
  central:
    exposure:
      loadBalancer:
        enabled: false
        port: 443
      nodePort:
        enabled: false
      route:
        enabled: true
    db:
      isEnabled: Default
      persistence:
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: central-db
    persistence:
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: stackrox-db
  egress:
    connectivityPolicy: Offline
EOF
```

> Note: The values we used for the `Central` instance are all defaults, aside from `connectivityPolicy: Offline`, which tells Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security it will be operating in a disconnected environment.

Once the `Central` resource has been created you can check the state of the RHACS pods by running `oc get pods -n acs-central` in your highside terminal. Or navigating to **Workloads** > **Pods** for the `acs-central` project in the OpenShift Web Console.
