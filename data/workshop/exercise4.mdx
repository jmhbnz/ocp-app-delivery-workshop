IPSec was a quick job and the cluster is looking good after enabling it. Your afternoon job is to pair up with Angie again and review the vulnerability status of the ACME Financial Services workloads that are deployed on the cluster so far.

Angie is really keen to tap into your knowledge on what she can do to make to the most of the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Platform.

You're in a meeting room going over things together, so far so good.


## 4.1 Oh *$%# that is really bad

You're looking over the **Vulnerability Management** > **Workload CVE's** > **Namespace View** together in the RHACS console.

You and Angie both spot it at the same time...
