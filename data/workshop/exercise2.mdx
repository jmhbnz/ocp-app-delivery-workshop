Itâ€™s your first day of the consulting engagement with ACME. Youâ€™ve paired up with one of their Senior Platform Engineers Angie who has just given you a tour of their newly deployed OpenShift cluster which is looking healthy ðŸ¥¦ (whew!) .

Time to tackle the first task on our consulting engagement list, installing [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/4.5/html-single/installing/index) via the operator.

Ultimately the ACME team wants to manage everything with GitOps, but for today Angie would prefer a guided walkthrough on how to do things using the OpenShift Web Console so she has an opportunity to learn more about each step of the process.
