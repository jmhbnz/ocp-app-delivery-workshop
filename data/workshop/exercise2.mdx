Itâ€™s your first day of the consulting engagement with ACME. Youâ€™ve paired up with one of their Senior Platform Engineers Angie who has just given you a tour of their newly deployed OpenShift cluster which is looking healthy ðŸ¥¦ (whew!) .

Time to tackle the first task on our consulting engagement list, installing [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/4.5/html-single/installing/index) via the operator.

Ultimately the ACME team wants to manage everything with GitOps, but for today Angie would prefer a guided walkthrough on how to do things using the OpenShift Web Console so she has an opportunity to learn more about each step of the process.

## 2.1 Installing the rhacs operator

Youâ€™re in front of a screen together with the Web Console open. The first step of installing the operator should be easy, better get started!

The only requirement Angie has requested for the Advanced Cluster Security operator installation is that all future operator updates must be approved **Manually**. She explains that several platform team members have PTSD from previous upgrades happening automatically and bringing down ACME's EFTPOS platform so now automatic updates are disabled everywhere.

## 2.2 Deploying central services

With the operator installed and healthy we now need to deploy an instance of **Central** for Angie. This Central instance will provide the management interface, API and secure the full fleet of ACMEâ€™s OpenShift clusters along with some EKS clusters ACME are currently running in AWS.

Angie has shared a high level design with you that states the Central services need to be deployed to the `prd-acme-rhacs` namespace.
