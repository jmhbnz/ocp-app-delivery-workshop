The disconnected OpenShift cluster you have been allocated is the result of a standard installation using the IPI install method, and does not have any post installation features added.

In a broad sense many OpenShift features are added via [Operators](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/what-are-openshift-operators). Operators automate the creation, configuration, and management of instances of Kubernetes-native applications. Operators can provide automation at every level of the stackâ€”from managing the parts that make up the platform all the way to applications that are provided as a managed service.

In the previous exercise we mirrored some new operator bundles into our disconnected network. In this exercise we'll install those operators and explore the features they provide us via [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources) they provide.
