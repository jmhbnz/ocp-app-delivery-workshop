Welcome to the OpenShift 4 Disconnected security & compliance workshop! Here you'll learn about operating a secure and compliant OpenShift 4 cluster in a disconnected network using the following key OpenShift features:

- [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes)
- [Red Hat OpenShift Compliance Operator](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/a-guide-to-openshift-compliance-operator-best-practices)
- [Red Hat Developer Hub](https://developers.redhat.com/rhdh/overview)

To level set, [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is a unified platform to build, modernize, and deploy applications at scale. OpenShift supports running in disconnected networks, though this does change the way the cluster operates because key ingredients like container images, operator bundles, and helm charts must be brought into the environment from the outside world via mirroring.

There are of course many different options for installing OpenShift in a restricted network; this workshop will not cover the deployment of a cluster, instead you will have an existing installed cluster allocated to you which has been created in advance. Your tasks during this workshop will be to improve the security and compliance of the cluster and workloads running on it.

**Let's get started!**
