In this first hands on excercise we will prepare our cluster for running Windows nodes by installing an operator and configuring it.

[Operators](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/operators/index.html) are among the most important components of OpenShift Container Platform. Operators are the preferred method of packaging, deploying, and managing additional cluster services or application.

To install Operators on OpenShift we use Operator Hub. A simplistic way of thinking about Operator Hub is as the "App Store" for your OpenShift cluster.

## 2.1 - Enable hybrid networking

Before installing the windows machine config operator our first step as a cluster administrator is configure a our OpenShift cluster network to allow Linux and Windows nodes to host Linux and Windows workloads, respectively.

This requires enabling a feature called **[hybrid overlay networking](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-hybrid-networking.html#configuring-hybrid-ovnkubernetes)**.

To configure hybrid overlay networking, run the following command in your bastion host terminal:

```bash
oc patch networks.operator.openshift.io cluster --type=merge \
  -p '{
    "spec":{
      "defaultNetwork":{
        "ovnKubernetesConfig":{
          "hybridOverlayConfig":{
            "hybridClusterNetwork":[
              {
                "cidr": "10.132.0.0/14",
                "hostPrefix": 23
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

## 2.2 - Install the windows machine config operator

If you have a running OpenShift cluster and have enabled hybrid overlay networking, you can then install the optional **Windows Machine Config Operator**. This operator will configure any Windows machines we add to the cluster, enabling Windows container workloads to be run within your OpenShift cluster. 

Windows instances can be added either by creating a `MachineSet`, or by specifying existing instances through a `ConfigMap`. The operator will do all the necessary steps to configure the instance so that it can join the cluster as a worker node.

Follow the steps below to install the operator:
1. Navigate to **Operators** > **OperatorHub** in the left menu.
2. Search for `Windows`.
3. Click on **Windows Machine Config Operator** provided by Red Hat and click **Install**.
4. Leave all settings as the default and click **Install** once more.

> Note: The operator installation may take several minutes to complete. Wait for the status of `âœ… succeeded` before continuing with the following step.

## 2.3 - Create configuration secrets

The windows machine config operator expects a secret to be present in its namespace called `cloud-private-key` containing a private key. This private key will be used to log into the soon to be provisioned Windows machine and set it up as an OpenShift node.

Run the commands below from your bastion host to create the required secret.

1. Generate a new ssh key with `ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ${HOME}/.ssh/winkey -q -N ''`
2. Run the command below to create the required secret from the public key you just created.

```bash
oc create secret generic cloud-private-key \
  --from-file=private-key.pem=${HOME}/.ssh/winkey \
  --namespace openshift-windows-machine-config-operator
```

Once your network configuration, operator installation and secret creation are complete you're ready to move on to the next exercise ðŸŽ‰
