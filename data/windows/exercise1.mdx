Welcome to the OpenShift Windows Containers Workshop! Here you'll have a chance to build your windows container prowess.  

With a Red Hat subscription, you can get support for running Windows workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.

For this workshop you'll be given a fresh OpenShift 4 cluster which currently only runs linux containers. You will complete a series of exercises to transform the cluster to be capable to run Windows containers.

**Let's get started!**


## 1.1 - Obtaining your environment

To get underway open your web browser and navigate to the following link to reserve yourself a user https://demo.redhat.com/workshop/98b7pu.  You can reserve an environment by entering any email address along with the password provided by your workshop facilitator.

After entering an email and the provided password you'll be presented with a console url and login credentials for your OpenShift cluster.

Open the console url and login.

## 1.3 - Logging into your bastion host

Along with the cluster web console we will also use the command line during this workshop. You've been allocated a bastion host that you can ssh to as part of step 1.1.

Follow the steps below to connect to your environment bastion host:

1. Open your preferrred terminal application.
2. Enter `ssh lab-user@<bastion-hostname>` replacing `<bastion-hostname>` with the hostname listed in your **Bastion Access** environment details page.
3. Enter `yes` if you receive a host key verification prompt. This only appears as it is the first time you have connected to this host.
4. When prompted enter the password mentioned under **Bastion Access** in your environment details page.

Congratulations, you're now ready to proceed with the next exercise ðŸŽ‰.
