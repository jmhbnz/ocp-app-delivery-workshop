Now that our cluster is ready to support Windows nodes lets provision one through the Machine API.

The Machine API is a combination of primary resources that are based on the upstream [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) project and custom OpenShift Container Platform resources.

The two primary resources are:

**1. Machines**

> A fundamental unit that describes the host for a Node. A machine has a providerSpec, which describes the types of compute nodes that are offered for different cloud platforms. For example, a machine type for a worker node on Amazon Web Services (AWS) might define a specific machine type and required metadata.

**2. MachineSets**

> Groups of machines. MachineSets are to machines as ReplicaSets are to Pods. If you need more machines or must scale them down, you change the **replicas** field on the MachineSet to meet your compute need.


## 3.1 Create a single replica machineset

In this exercise we will create a `MachineSet`. Once created this will automatically begin provisoning a Windows machine and adding it to our cluster as a worker node.

Below is a YAML snippet we will use as base to create our `MachineSet`:

```yaml
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: cluster-<id>-windows-ap-southeast-<zone>
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
  labels:
    machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: cluster-<id>
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: cluster-<id>
      machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset: cluster-<id>-worker-ap-southeast-<zone>
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: cluster-<id>
        machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role: worker
        machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-type: worker
        machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset: cluster-<id>-worker-ap-southeast-<zone>
        machine.openshift.io/os-id: Windows
    spec:
      lifecycleHooks: {}
      metadata:
        labels:
          node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ''
      providerSpec:
        value:
          userDataSecret:
            name: windows-user-data
          placement:
            availabilityZone: ap-southeast-<zone>
            region: ap-southeast-1
          credentialsSecret:
            name: aws-cloud-credentials
          instanceType: m5a.4xlarge
          metadata:
            creationTimestamp: null
          blockDevices:
            - ebs:
                iops: 0
                kmsKey: {}
                volumeSize: 120
                volumeType: gp2
          securityGroups:
            - filters:
                - name: 'tag:Name'
                  values:
                    - cluster-<id>-worker-sg
          kind: AWSMachineProviderConfig
          metadataServiceOptions: {}
          tags:
            - name: kubernetes.io/cluster/cluster-<id>
              value: owned
          deviceIndex: 0
          ami:
            id: ami-0e76083a67107f741
          subnet:
            filters:
              - name: 'tag:Name'
                values:
                  - cluster-<id>-private-ap-southeast-<zone>
          apiVersion: awsproviderconfig.openshift.io/v1beta1
          iamInstanceProfile:
            id: cluster-<id>-worker-profile
```

There are ten references to `<id>` in the sample that we need to find & replace with the actual cluster id for the cluster we have been allocated for the workshop and five references to the availability `<zone>` for our cluster nodes that we also need to update with our actual zone in use.

Run the following command in your bastion host terminal session to find your cluster id and zone:

```bash
name=$(oc get machineset -A -o jsonpath={.items[0].metadata.name})
echo "Cluster id is: ${name:8:11}"
echo "Cluster availability zone is: ${name:40:2}"
```

After retrieving your cluster id and zone update the sample `MachineSet` using your preferred text editor, then select and copy all of the text to clipboard.

Within OpenShift you can then click the ➕ button in the top right hand corner, paste in your yaml and click **Create**.

## 3.2 Verify windows machine status

After creating the `MachineSet` a new Windows machine will be automatically provisioned and added to our OpenShift cluster, as we set our desired replicas in the YAML to `1`.

Creating, provisioning and configuring a new Windows host can be a lengthy process taking 15-30 minutes so now is a good time to take a break ☕.

You can keep an eye on the status of your Machine in the OpenShift web console. Once it reaches the **✅ Provisioned as node** status you are ready to proceed to the next exercise.
