Welcome to the OpenShift 4 Disconnected Workshop! Here you'll learn about operating an OpenShift 4 cluster in a disconnected network, for our purposes today that will be a network without access to the internet (even through a proxy or firewall).

To level set, Red Hat [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is a unified platform to build, modernize, and deploy applications at scale. OpenShift supports running in disconnected networks, though this does change the way the cluster operates because key ingredients like container images, operator bundles, and helm charts must be brought into the environment from the outside world via mirroring.

There are of course many different options for installing OpenShift in a restricted network; this workshop will primarily cover one opinionated approach. We'll do our best to point out where there's the potential for variability along the way.

**Let's get started!**


## 1.1 - Obtaining your environment

To get underway open your web browser and navigate to this etherpad link to reserve yourself a user https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/OpenShiftDisco_2023_12_20.  You can reserve a user by noting your name or initials next to a user that has not yet been claimed.

## 1.2 - Opening your web terminal

Throughout the remainder of the workshop you will be using a number of command line interface tools for example, `aws` to quickly interact with resources in Amazon Web Services, and `ssh` to login to a remote server.

To save you from needing to install or configure these tools on your own device for the remainder of this workshop a web terminal will be available for you.

Simply copy the link next to the user your reserved in etherpad and paste into your browser. If you are prompted to login select `htpass` and enter the credentials listed in etherpad.


## 1.3 - Creating an air gap

According to the [Internet Security Glossary](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4949), an Air Gap is:

> "an interface between two systems at which (a) they are not connected physically and (b) any logical connection is not automated (i.e., data is transferred through the interface only manually, under human control)." 

In disconnected OpenShift installations, the air gap exists between the **Low Side** and the **High Side**, so it is between these systems where a manual data transfer, or **sneakernet** is required.

For the purposes of this workshop we will be operating within Amazon Web Services. You have been allocated a set of credentials for an environment that already has some basic preparation completed. This will be a single VPC with 3 public subnets, which will serve as our **Low Side**, and 3 private subnets, which will serve as our **High Side**.

The diagram below shows a simplified overview of the networking topology:

Let's check the virtual private cloud network is created using the `aws` command line interface by copying the command below into our web terminal:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-vpcs | jq '.Vpcs[] | select(.Tags[].Value=="disco").VpcId' -r
```

You should see output similar to the example below:

```text
vpc-0e6d176c7d9c94412
```

We can also check our three public **Low side** and three private **High side** subnets are ready to go by running the command below in our web terminal:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-subnets | jq '[.Subnets[].Tags[] | select(.Key=="Name").Value] | sort'
```

We should see output matching this example:

```bash
[
   "Private Subnet - disco",
   "Private Subnet 2 - disco",
   "Private Subnet 3 - disco",
   "Public Subnet - disco",
   "Public Subnet 2 - disco",
   "Public Subnet 3 - disco"
]
```

If your environment access and topology is all working you've finished exercise 1! ðŸŽ‰
