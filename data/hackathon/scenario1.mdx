Welcome to the OpenShift Virtualisation Hackathon! Here you'll have a chance to build your container native virtualisation prowess. Exercises will award points for each correct solution. 

You're in a race to reach the highest score before the session concludes! If multiple teams complete all exercises so share points totals a further ranking will be done by elapsed time based on when slack messages are sent.

**Let's get started!**


## 1.1 - The hackathon scenario

<Zoom>

</Zoom>

Acme Financial Services is a large bank based in Australia. They have a number of virtual machine workloads that are running on a traditional hypervisor and are considering moving these to another platform.

One of the potential options for Acme Financial Services is to adopt Red Hat OpenShift Virtualisation as a container native virtualisation platform. 

Your hackathon team are the pre-sales technical team engaging with Acme technical teams to secure buy-in for a large scale migration to proceed.


## 1.1 - Understanding the environment

For this challenge you'll be given a fresh bare metal OpenShift 4 cluster **with the OpenShift Virtualisation operator already installed**.

All challenge tasks must be performed on this cluster so your solutions can be graded successfully.

You can and are encouraged to use any supporting documentation or other resources in order to tackle each of the challenge tasks.

## 1.2 - Obtain your environment

Working in a small team you will have one shared cluster for team members to share. Your team will have a name allocated already.

To get underway open your web browser and navigate to this link to allocate an environment for your team https://demo.redhat.com/workshop/s72ya3.

Register for an environment using `[team name]@redhat.com` and the password provided by your hackathon organisers. Registering with a team email will mean all your team members will be able to see the same cluster details for your shared team cluster.

## 1.4 - Confirm environment access

If your team have secured an environment and are ready to start the challenge please post a message in `#event-anz-ocp-virt-hackathon` with the message:

> [team name] have logged into an environment and are starting the challenge!

The event team will reply in slack to confirm your team has been recorded and start you with a base score of `10` points.


## 1.5 - Hints!

If you get stuck on a question, fear not, perhaps try a different approach. If you have tried everything you can think of and are still stuck you can unlock a hint for `3` points by posting a message in the `#event-anz-ocp-virt-hackathon` channel with the message:

> [team name] are stuck on [exercise] and are unlocking a hint.

A hackathon organiser will join your breakout room to share the hint with you ðŸ¤«.
